                    I'm originally from Hinesville GA, where I graduated High School and attended
                    Georgia Southern University. After two years at GSU I joined the military and served
                    for five years as an active duty soldier. While serving, I worked jointly with other branches
                    at the NSA facility located on Oahu, HI where I worked as a Signal Intelligence Analyst and Chinese Linguist.
                    While serving I also recieved an associates in Mandarin Chinese and a Bachelors of Science in Business Finance.
                    After leaving the military I worked within retail management while obtaining my degree in 
                    Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University. I am now seeking my first job position within the software development community.

                    I have been married to my wife Rachel Mae Sells for almost eight years.
                    Rachel came to America from the Philipines in 2007. We met working at the same
                    Walmart, and got married during my first year in the service. She is currently finishing her
                    studies as a medical coding and billing specialist and hopes to begin working her chosen occupation as well.

                    I have many hobbies, but the one I am most passionate about is tennis. I am an 
                    avid tennis fan and I play anytime I get the chance. I have volunteered several years as 
                    a High School tennis coach and I play in several local amatuer leagues and tournamets.
